# Sailplanner: The anticipatory pleasure...

Welcome to Sailplanner, an online tool to plan your sailing cruises.
In a few moments you'll see what remote places can be reached during your holiday,
how much time different parts of the journey will cost, and at what time you'll arrive.

You can save the planner and share the link with your crew, or your friends at home.
Different export-formats are available (GeoJSON, GPX, KML).
